# Model Artifacts - Behavioral and Structural Models

This directory contains formal models that describe the expected behaviors and interactions of the WASM Arrow library. These models serve as the authoritative specification for test generation and system validation.

## Modeling Formalism

We use **JSON-based state machines** and **statecharts** as our primary modeling formalism, chosen for:
- Machine readability for automated test generation
- Version control compatibility
- Cross-platform tool support
- Integration with JavaScript test frameworks

## Model Categories

### 1. Behavioral Models (`behavioral/`)

#### State Machines (`state_machines/`)
- **Module Lifecycle Model** (`module_lifecycle.json`): WASM module initialization, operation, and cleanup
- **Table Lifecycle Model** (`table_lifecycle.json`): Table creation, operations, and disposal
- **Memory Management Model** (`memory_management.json`): Handle allocation, reference counting, disposal

#### API Interaction Models (`api_interactions/`)
- **Table Operations Flow** (`table_operations.json`): Sequence of table creation and manipulation
- **Data Conversion Flow** (`data_conversion.json`): JSON ↔ Arrow ↔ WASM transformations
- **Error Handling Flow** (`error_handling.json`): Error conditions and recovery paths

### 2. Structural Models (`structural/`)

#### Component Architecture (`architecture/`)
- **Module Dependencies** (`module_dependencies.json`): Inter-module relationships and interfaces
- **API Surface Model** (`api_surface.json`): Public API structure and contracts

#### Data Flow Models (`data_flow/`)
- **Type System Model** (`type_system.json`): Data type definitions and conversions
- **Memory Layout Model** (`memory_layout.json`): WASM memory organization and access patterns

### 3. Error Models (`error/`)
- **Error State Model** (`error_states.json`): All possible error conditions
- **Recovery Paths Model** (`recovery_paths.json`): Error recovery and cleanup procedures

## Model Schema

All models follow a consistent JSON schema:

```json
{
  "model_id": "unique_identifier",
  "model_type": "state_machine" | "statechart" | "data_flow" | "component",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Human-readable description",
  "states": [
    {
      "id": "state_id",
      "name": "Human readable name",
      "type": "initial" | "normal" | "final" | "error",
      "properties": {},
      "invariants": ["condition1", "condition2"]
    }
  ],
  "transitions": [
    {
      "id": "transition_id",
      "from": "source_state_id",
      "to": "target_state_id",
      "trigger": "event_name",
      "guard": "condition",
      "action": "action_name",
      "requirements": ["REQ-001", "REQ-002"]
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "created": "2025-01-01",
    "author": "Model Author",
    "requirements": ["REQ-001", "REQ-002", "REQ-003"]
  }
}
```

## Test Generation Mapping

### Model Elements → Test Cases
- **States** → Test oracles and assertions
- **Transitions** → Test steps and sequences
- **Guards** → Precondition validation
- **Actions** → API calls and operations
- **Invariants** → Continuous validation checks

### Coverage Metrics
- **State Coverage**: Percentage of states visited during testing
- **Transition Coverage**: Percentage of transitions exercised
- **Path Coverage**: Percentage of valid state sequences tested

## Model Validation

All models must pass validation before test generation:

1. **Schema Validation**: Conform to JSON schema
2. **Semantic Validation**: Logical consistency checks
3. **Completeness**: All requirements mapped to model elements
4. **Reachability**: All states reachable from initial state

## Regenerating Tests

When models are updated:

1. Validate model changes
2. Regenerate affected test cases
3. Update traceability matrix
4. Re-run test suite
5. Update coverage reports

## Tools and Scripts

```bash
# Validate all models
npm run models:validate

# Generate tests from models
npm run models:generate

# Update traceability matrix
npm run models:trace

# Model coverage analysis
npm run models:coverage
```

## Model Versioning

- Models are versioned with semantic versioning
- Breaking changes require major version increment
- All model changes tracked in `CHANGELOG.md`
- Test regeneration required for model updates
