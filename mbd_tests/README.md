# Model-Based Development (MBD) Test Suite

This directory contains the Model-Based Development infrastructure for the WASM Arrow library, implementing a comprehensive testing approach that ensures conformance to the API specification through formal models and automated test generation.

## Directory Structure

### `/models/` - Model Artifacts
Contains behavioral and structural models that describe the expected behaviors and interactions of the WASM module:

- **Behavioral Models**: State machines, statecharts, API interaction flows
- **Structural Models**: Component architecture, data flow, type system models
- **Error Models**: Error conditions, recovery paths, and edge cases
- **Memory Models**: Memory management patterns, handle lifecycle, disposal workflows

### `/generated/` - Generated Test Cases
Auto-generated executable test cases derived from the behavioral models:

- **API Conformance Tests**: Each API endpoint tested against specification
- **State Transition Tests**: All valid/invalid state changes
- **Error Condition Tests**: All error paths and recovery scenarios
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflows from models

### `/harness/` - Test Automation Framework
Test execution infrastructure and automation scripts:

- **Browser Automation**: Headless and headed browser testing
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari compatibility testing
- **Test Runners**: Local development and CI execution scripts
- **Environment Setup**: Test server configuration and utilities

### `/reports/` - Test Reports and Coverage
Generated test reports with coverage and traceability information:

- **Test Results**: Pass/fail summaries with detailed failure analysis
- **Model Coverage**: Percentage of model states/transitions exercised
- **Code Coverage**: Implementation coverage for JS/WASM glue code
- **Performance Reports**: Benchmark results and regression detection

### `/performance/` - Performance Benchmarks
Performance testing infrastructure and baseline metrics:

- **Baseline Metrics**: Recorded performance characteristics per browser
- **Benchmark Scripts**: Automated performance tests
- **Regression Detection**: Performance change tracking
- **Resource Monitoring**: Memory usage and leak detection

## Model-Based Development Workflow

1. **Model Design**: Create formal models describing expected system behavior
2. **Test Generation**: Automatically derive test cases from models
3. **Traceability**: Maintain mappings between requirements ↔ models ↔ tests
4. **Execution**: Run tests against implementation in browser environments
5. **Coverage**: Measure both model coverage and implementation coverage
6. **Iteration**: Refine models and tests based on failures and gaps

## Key Principles

- **Formal Models**: All behavior captured in executable, versioned models
- **Automated Generation**: Tests derived systematically from models
- **Complete Traceability**: Every requirement traced to model elements and test cases
- **Browser-First**: All tests execute in real browser environments
- **Cross-Browser**: Comprehensive compatibility matrix validation
- **Performance Aware**: Built-in performance monitoring and regression detection

## Usage

```bash
# Run all model-driven tests
npm run test:models

# Generate tests from models
npm run generate:tests

# Run cross-browser test suite
npm run test:browsers

# Generate coverage reports
npm run coverage:report

# Run performance benchmarks
npm run benchmark
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- ≥90% model coverage for mandatory behaviors
- 100% pass rate for blocking/critical tests
- Complete traceability matrix (requirement ↔ model ↔ test)
- Performance within documented baselines
- Cross-browser compatibility verified
